# Auto installing n-curses c program for arch linux
## About
An n-curses program in c which installs and sets up an arch linux system. Meant to be used after a base install of arch linux, might work for a more developed system. Might be a little bit more different than the bash scripts. Not finished yet, but when I do, there might be occasional updates adding features, fixing bugs or improving efficiency.

## Installation
For now, git clone the directory then compile with gcc.

## Usage 
To use just run the compiled main program then go through the menu set up

## TODO
				- User set up
				- DWM set up
				- program installation
				- zsh set up
