# Arch auto installing config
## About
A bash script which is meant to be used after setting up an initial arch linux install, but can also be used for a more developed system. Not finished yet, when I finish it I may add some features later and improve it.

## Instalation
git clone the bash-script folder and everything should be set up (assuming you have bash and sudo/doas/run by root)

## Usage
To use either run the main.bash script or run individual scripts depending on what you want, they are modulised for a reason. After the script finishes everything should be set up but a restart may be required.
